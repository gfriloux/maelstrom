shotgun is an xmpp client/library which uses EFL. it requires core EFL.
the GUI requires elementary and efx

shotgun:sawed-off is a module for E17. it depends on edbus2.

on loading the sawed-off module, the first thing (and only thing) you'll need 
to do is create (key)bindings for the actions. the important ones are "Toggle 
Reply Entry" and "Toggle First Link".

"Toggle Reply Entry" - this action shows, at a position of your choosing from 
the associated config dialog, a small popup. this popup contains a contact 
name, their icon, and a text entry. while open, pressing enter will send the 
current entry text to the named contact as though you were typing in their chat 
window (meaning it lets the gui do all the heavy lifting when it comes to 
determining which presences to send to). 
when open, the popup will grab keyboard focus. this can be disrupted if an e 
menu is opened. simply activate the binding again to hide it. the following 
keys are reserved when the entry is shown:
* Escape - hide the popup
* Return/KP_Enter - send current text to displayed contact
* ctrl+alt+{left,right} - cycle through online contacts in order of message 
frequency (clears entry text)

"Toggle First Link" - this action shows, at a position relatively close to 
(hopefully, depending on your elm version) the position of the shotgun contact 
list, the tooltip for the last link sent. this behavior can be modified to 
ignore links that you have sent in the config dialog. adding a method to open 
links in web browser is also planned, but not currently implemented.
no keys are reserved when a tooltip is shown; activate the binding again to 
hide it.
